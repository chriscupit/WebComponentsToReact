WebComponentsToReact

This activity uses an application that pulls movie showtime data from a JSON file namedâ€¯movies.json.  Each movie you see in the web browser is a Web component, and it needed to be converted into React components instead.  I have started making some improvements to the application by adding a navbar and changing some of the coloring but more is needed.  To run this application, open a local server.
